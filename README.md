# We Out

### [App](http://we-out.herokuapp.com)
### [Demo](https://youtu.be/SgFyUfkfSFM)

This is the first version of a web application built by software engineers, Karina Macancela and Belle Poopongpanit. This app aims to allow users to create a profile to find and create events based on location and category. Users can add comments on each event. Users can edit and delete their account (along with their comments). User can find their events on their dashboard. 

Utilized JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, bcrypt, Bootstrap, SQLite, and jQuery.

Future goals: Will be adding Eventbrite and StubHub APIs to suggest events to users around their area.
